      <h1>Generalizing graph theory</h1>
<p>01 Dec 2020 - Lawrence Borst</p>

<p>Here we will look at a generalization of graph theory. All visualizations were made in Blender3D.</p>

<p>There are many ways to generalize graph theory. One way is with the “hypergraph”, which in essence is a graph where edges can connect to more than $2$ vertices. This is easy to visualize if we imagine edges as being able to “branch”. A bit of imagination can lead us to other generalizations, and here I present one I came up with that motivates the rich theory of CW complexes.</p>

<h2>Generalizing Finite, Connected Planar Graphs and Euler's Theorem</h2>
<p>In particular, let us try to generalize connected simple planar graphs, because they are quite “nice”. Firstly, they are graphs, but they are also fundamentally geometric, as planar graphs are those that can be embedded in the plane. We will extend two theorems: firstly, connected simple planar graphs have the property (Euler’s Theorem) that, if $v$, $e$, $f$ be the number of vertices, edges and faces respectively.</p>

<p>Euler’s Theorem: If a finite, connected planar graph is drawn in the plane without edge intersections, then</p>

\[v-e+f=2\]

<p>Secondly, planar graphs can be embedded onto the plane without any edges intersecting. In fact, note how neither vertices, edges nor faces intersect other vertices, edges or faces respectively. In fact(!), note how—if we identify vertices as points, edges as lines and faces as bounded open sets filling in the space between edges (polygons)—neither points, edges or faces intersect other points, edges or faces.</p>

<p>Euler’s Theorem is a little misleading as it stands now because I haven’t quite defined what constitutes a “face”. In particular, for graphs that can be embedded into a bounded subset of the plane, we still take the “outside” of the graph to be counted as a face. We shall see, rather surprisingly, that in the generalization here it is maybe more elegant to say that the “outside” does not constitute a face and that $v-e+f=1$.</p>

<p>In fact, there is a lot to be tightly, mathematically formulated. But this is not necessary, because I only want to illustrate the ideas involved in generalizing planar graphs.</p>

<p>The first thing to note is that connected simple planar graphs are, well, planar. That is, they are clearly embedded into the 2D plane, i.e. 2D euclidean space. We might expect a generalization to be 3-dimensional. The obvious generalization is what computer scientists call a polygon mesh, which intuitively can be viewed as a volume whose boundary is a set of poylgons (though this does not rule out pathological cases). Examples are, of course, polyhedra, but also complicated volumes that have been, as they say, triangulated. Indeed we shall go with polygonal meshes.</p>

<p>Now we notice how a polygonal mesh “glues” to another polygonal mesh; it is quite clear it can be glued by a face. Let’s go with that idea, because in the planar graphs we have discussed a face can be glued to a face by an edge, and an edge can be glued to an edge by a vertex. Furthermore, we don’t necessarily disallow gluing faces together by vertices; for this reason we can glue polygonal meshes by vertices, or edges as well. This is very elegant.</p>

<p>For the sake of brevity, let us call the generalization of a “face” a “room”. The following shape has $1$ room, $4$ faces, $6$ edges and $4$ vertices.</p>

<p>SHOW TETRAHEDRON</p>

<p>The following more complicated shape has $2$ rooms, $10$ faces, $15$ edges and $8$ vertices. Note how, when two rooms are glued together, they share a face, not two faces.</p>

<p>SHOW SECOND SHAPE</p>

<p>Now, let us try to generalize Euler’s formula. We will, for simplicity, disregard the face “outside” the shape, so that for simply connected planar graphs $V-E+F=1$. If a generalization for the planar case exist to higher dimensions, then we might expect the existence also of a “reduction” to lower dimensions. In $d=1$, we have a graph that we may draw on a line. The rules are: (1) we may draw a vertex or an edge and (2) edges and vertices may not intersect other edges and vertices. Furthermore, we shall not take the “outside” part as an edge. The reader can convince him/herself that such graphs satisfy $V-E=1$. If we had taken the “outside” as an edge, we would have $V-E=0$. Now let’s go zero-dimensional. We have a euclidean space that consists of a single point. This point can be the vertex, but no edges can be added (because they are one-dimensional) and no additional vertices (because (1) vertices would intersect and (2) there would be no edges connecting them). Clearly Euler’s formula is then $V=1$.</p>

<p>So we have seen that Euler’s formula for $n=0$, $1$, $2$ is $V=1$, $V-E=1$ and $V-E+F=1$. There is a clear pattern, and let us conjecturet that in 3D $V-E+F-R=1$ where $R$ is the number of “rooms”.</p>

<p>Looking at the two 3D shapes given, we indeed find that $V-E+F-R=1$ in both cases(!). It seems like we have found a valid generalization of Euler’s formula, and this is indeed the case.</p>

<h1 id="cw-complexes">CW-Complexes</h1>
<p>We will see that the above discussion ties in very naturally with an accepted generalization of graphs, namely CW-complexes. These are more abstract, topological objects that generalize the hierarchy of vertices, edges, faces and so on, with rules prescribing how they are combined. The complex is then the graph. The definition is particularly simple in the case of finite graphs. CW-complexes are made from $n$-cells, so let’s first define those.</p>

<p><strong>Definition</strong>: An $n$-cell is a space homeomorphic to the open $n$-disk $int(D^{n})$. A cell is a space which is an $n$-cell for some $n \geq 0$.</p>

<p>Here we define $D^{n} = \left \{ x : \left | x \right | \leq 1 \right \}$.</p>

<p>Here the</p>

<p><strong>Definition</strong>:</p>

<p>Intuitively the first axiom tells us two things: (1) that each cell can be built from the $n$-disk, should we allow continuously deforming it into $X$, and (2) that the boundary of such a cell is restricted to $X^{n-1}$. The first part intuitively captures the natural progression from points, to curves, to surfaces, to volumes that we have seen in graphs. The second part, based on our previous discussion, says that faces have boundaries that contain vertices and edges, but NOT “rooms”. In graph theory we would naturally not define the boundary of an edge to be a face; it makes much more sense for it to be a vertex. This is captured here. Furthermore, this tacitly embodies the idea that graphs are made from “gluing” together different components.</p>

<p>The second axiom is more subtle, and rules out pathological cases. The same can be said of the thirrd axiom, and in fact they are superfluous if E is finite.</p>
