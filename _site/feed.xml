This perception owes itself in part to its strangeness, but also to scientific principles that make many types of microtonal music unattractive to the uninitiated. For example, imagine a pitch. Play it in your head, and then layer it with a second pitch just slightly above the first. What you’re hearing is a dissonant interval, and we shall go over the reason why that may be. We will attempt to categorize chords by their “pleasantness” to the ear, and show how this problem can be handled mathematically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But before we can dive into microtonality we need to understand Western tuning, how sound is perceived, and what makes a sound pleasant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Octave, Pitches and Sound Waves&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good starting point is the octave. The octave is an interval, meaning it denotes a pitch relationship between two notes. The octave is a natural starting point when it comes to tuning. When I play a C4 and a C5 simultaneously on a piano, it will sound harmonious. Perfect. In fact, the C4 and C5 “feel” similar, and musicians may use terms like “perfect octave” to describe such assonant intervals. You could say C5 sounds like a “higher” C4. But when we shift somewhere arbitrary, like E5, we would not say it sounds like a “higher” C4… But we could say it sounds like a higher E4-if you’re human, that is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A pitch in music is a perceptual property of sound. A sound is a pressure wave, and for a pitched sound, the pressure it carries to your ear will be periodic. A sound wave can be quite arbitrary; pitch will be perceived as long as it is periodic. Your brain is able to distinguish the frequency of sound, and from this frequency perceives a pitch. While we’ll talk a lot about “pitch”, I remind the reader that pitch is only a perception, and the frequency of sound waves is fundamentally where music happens physically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what makes the octave special? It is this: if the “lower” sound has pitch $x$, then the “higher” sound will have pitch $2x$. Precisely $2x$. If we begin to deviate, by playing at say a frequency of $2x+\epsilon$, the resulting interval will sound less harmonious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t think we fundamentally know &lt;b&gt;why&lt;/b&gt; our brains favor intervals such as this—in fact, it isn’t even clear if animals have opinions about intervals at all—but it seems to be the way it works. We can, however, make a guess why the two pitches sound “similar”. Maybe it is because a sound with frequency $2x$ necessarily also has frequency $x$. This does, however, not reveal why the magic number is $2$, instead of $3$ or something. (But the brain &lt;b&gt;does&lt;/b&gt; favor sounds at frequencies $x$ and $3x$ played simultaneously. This would be a perfect twelfth, and sounds harmonious, but nothing like duplicating a sound)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Equal Temperament Tuning&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We shall briefly look at the Western tuning system, because microtonality naturally extends it. Western tuning—in particular what we might call equal temperament—can be constructed from two pieces of information: a reference pitch, and the number of equal intervals we split an octave into. The reference pitch acts like an “origin”, and in Western music we could set it at A4, which we define to be $440$Hz (ocillations/repetitions per second of a sound).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what should A5 be, one octave up? Well, $880$Hz, from the previous discussion. A6? Perhaps it is tempting to bet on $1320=3(440)$, but it is 1760Hz, because the relationship between A6 and A5 is the same between A5 and A4. That is, A6 doubles the frequency associated with A5, the same way A5 doubles that with A4.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reader may recognize that when we choose to split the octave into equal intervals, we are forced not to cut the octave into equal frequencies, but rather to pick frequencies in geometric progression. This multiplicative behavior may seem striking, but in a way pitch perception is not much different from how humans perceive many other stimuli (see Steven’s power law). Loudness, touch sensitivity, pitch and warmth perception all follow power laws with respect to our “perceived intensity”. In a sense, pitch and vibrations are related by Steven’s power law. Mathematically it doesn’t really matter if it’s a power law or a linear law… But I digress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if we start with A4 at $440$Hz, what frequency should the next note (Bb4) be? Well, say we wish to split A4 to A5 into twelve equal intervals, and each interval takes us further by a (multiplicative) factor of x. Then, moving up 12 steps (semitones), we get $440x^{12}=880$, giving $x=\sqrt[12]{2}$. Then Bb4 is at $440\sqrt[12]{2}\approx 466.16$.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point we can construct all $88$ keys on the keyboard with their associated frequencies. We’ll leave tuning at that for now, though the subject goes much deeper in practice—there are infinite families of tuning systems to draw from! The tuning system here is most commonly used on synthesizers, electric guitars, and keyboard instruments, just to name a few.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Mathematics of Consonant Intervals&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re nearing the prerequisite knowledge to understand how to tackle microtonality. But to solve the problem of finding pleasant chords in it, we need to understand “consonance” and “dissonance”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where “consonance” conveys something pleasant, “dissonance” conveys something unnerving. This is the same to how “consonance” and “dissonance” are used to talk about intervals. The mathematical machinery of consonant intervals is every bit as harmonious as its sound.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Roughly, when two notes $A$ and $B$ are heard, the “closer” the ratio between their associated frequencies $f(A):f(B)$ is to a rational number of the form $a:b$ with small $a$ and $b$ (coprime), the more harmonious it sounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, $f(A5):f(A4)=2:1$ is very harmonious. This is an the pitch ratio associated with an octave. For a perfect fifth, which is considered the “second-most” consonant interval, we have something like $f(A5):f(E5)=\sqrt[12]{2^{7}}\approx 1.498$ because a perfect fifth has 7 “steps” (semitones). This number is irrational, and so you may expect it to be very dissonant. But it is also awfully close to a “nice rational number”, namely $3:2=1.5$ That is why it sounds “nice”. In fact, we can see that octaves and perfect fifths sound “nice” everywhere on the keyboard, as long as the ratio of frequencies is conserved. We humans are so accustomed to thinking about pitch in this relative way that we are better at distinguishing the interval two notes make than any one note’s exact position! This is called relative pitch. I’ve heard of people with absolute pitch—the perception of pitches as “absolute” frequencies—feeling dumbfounded that most people perceive music in such a complex, roundabout way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But how do we characterize “closeness?” I have searched online for this, but couldn’t find any resources. On the internet there are scores of lists with these ratios related to the $12$ intervals we all know and love. But no derivation. I have chosen to show a personal method based on continued fractions. Every number $x\in \mathbb{R}$ can be expressed in the form:&lt;/p&gt;

\[x=a_{0}+\frac{1}{a_{1}+\frac{1}{a_{2}+\frac{1}{\ddots}}}\]

&lt;p&gt;Where $a_{i}\in \mathbb{Q}$. The above expression is the continued fraction expansion of $x$, and we often write $x=\left [ a_{0};a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3},\cdots  \right ]$. For rational $x$, this expression terminates. Conversely, every terminating continued fraction is rational. For irrational $x$, it doesn’t terminate. We can draw a lot of similarities between continued fraction and decimal expansions… But continued fractions are more powerful. The continued fraction of $x$ is the best approximation to $x$ in the following sense: if $p/q$ (coprime) is any one of those fractions obtained by truncating the full continued fraction, then it is impossible to find $r &amp;lt; q$ in $\mathbb{Z}$ such that $r/s$ is closer to $x$. Furthermore, the error is less than $\frac{1}{q^{2}}$.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We therefore choose to define the pitch ratio “close” to $x=\left [ a_{0};a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3},\cdots  \right ]$ as the truncated $\left [ a_{0};a_{1}  \right ]=a_{0}+1/a_{1}$.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how do we derive the coefficients? I’ll outline the derivation from The Princeton Companion of Mathematics; the trick comes from 13th century Indian and Arabian mathematics, and is based on the Euclidean algorithm. If we pick $m$ and $n$, and find unique quotient and remainder $q_{1}$, $r_{1}$ with $m=q_{1}n+r_{1}$ (constrained in the usual way), then $m/n=q_{1}+r_{1}/n=q_{1}+1/F$, where $F=n/r_{1}$.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ADD MORE&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s apply this to the perfect fifth. The pitch ratio associated with a perfect fifth is $x=\sqrt[12]{2^{7}}$. The integer part of $x$ is $1$, by inspection. The remainder is roughly $0.4983”, and the reciprocal of that is $2.0068$ with an integer part of $2$. This is all we need. We Therefore have $x$ close to $1+1/2=3/2$, just as we wanted!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The aim is to find a polynomial of degree $n$ that passes through $n-1$ points. People educated in linear algebra often can see that this is possible just by setting up the associated system of linear equations. For completeness:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If $P(x)=a_{0}+a_{1}x+\cdots+a_{n}x^{n}$ and $P(x_{0})=y_{0}$, $P(x_{1})=y_{1}$,$\cdots$,$P(x_{n-1})=y_{n-1}$ then we have the following system:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

\[y_{0}=a_{0}+a_{1}x_{0}+\cdots+a_{n}x_{0}^{n}\]

\[y_{1}=a_{0}+a_{1}x_{1}+\cdots+a_{n}x_{1}^{n}\]

\[\vdots\]

\[y_{n-1}=a_{0}+a_{1}x_{n-1}+\cdots+a_{n}x_{n-1}^{n}\]

&lt;p&gt;$n$ unknowns and $n$ equations. This we know is solveable. You can solve this by hand for a few points—and a computer will have no trouble with thousands of points—but our aim is to find a closed-form formula for the interpolating polynomial. Looking at this set of equations might not get us anywhere close to solving this problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of revealing the trick, I encourage the reader to think about the problem. A good line of reasoning is something like this: “The main difficulty is that when you assume a function $P(x)$ and tweak the coefficients to fit through some point, the polynomial will inevitably slip away from other points.” It is a bit like trying to get rid of a crease on your bedsheets; flattening one part will cause a pinch to pop up elsewhere. So then we might ask ourselves: “Is there a way to treat an individual point without disturbing the rest?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, consider one of the points we’re trying to pass through. If we can associate a polynomial (which is what the question is about) with an individual point that’s “nice” in a way that “does not disturb the others”, we would need a total of $n$ polynomials to address all points. Every polynomial should act in a similar way to its associated point, because no point is “special”. So something should be quite “natural” about this polynomial. It should pass through a point, and as for the others… Well, be equal to $0$ at the others (can you think of anything else?). This is quite a natural thing to do with the other points, and as it turns out, it is easy to find the associated polynomial. Promising.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s say $P_{i}(x)=0$ at $x=x_{j}$ for all $j \neq i$ and $P_{i}(x_{i})=y_{i}$. By the fundamental theorem of calculus, we have:&lt;/p&gt;

\[P_{i}(x)=C_{i}\prod_{j \neq i} (x - x_{j})\]

&lt;p&gt;For some constant $C_{i}$. Plugging in $P_{i}(x)=y_{i}$ gives $C_{i}=y_{i} / \prod_{j \neq i} (x_{i} - x_{j})$.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have tamed the problem in the sense that we can find a polynomial of degree $n-1$ through a given point, that equals $0$ at all the other points. The attempt so far may not lead anywhere—as happens often when you’re tackling a problem for the first time—but some thought reveals that the sum of all these polynomials goes through the points $(y_{0}, x_{0}), (y_{1}, x_{1}),\cdots,(y_{n-1}, x_{n-1})$. Therefore&lt;/p&gt;

\[P(x)=\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}y_{i} \frac{\prod_{j \neq i} (x - x_{j})}{\prod_{j \neq i} (x_{i} - x_{j})}\]
